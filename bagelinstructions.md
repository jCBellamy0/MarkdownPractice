How to Make Bagels
===================
Bagels are a breakfast staple food, and are relatively simple to make, requiring little experience and basic cooking supplies. Learning to make bagels gives you easy access to a cheap and healthy breakfast food of better quality than what you can get from  the grocery store.

The general workflow behind making bagels is to first prepare the dough, and then shape the dough and let it rest. Afterwards the shaped dough is boiled and finally baked to finish.

***Caution: Ensure that you wash your hands thoroughly before cooking to prevent spreading infection to any potential other who might consume your food. This recipe also involves the use of an oven and boiling water, which can cause burns if handled improperly. Use oven gloves/mitts when dealing with anything exposed to high heat.***

### Ingredients/Equipment
* 1 1/2 cups warm (110 F) water
* 2 3/4 tsp active dry yeast
* 4+ cups of bread flour (additional flour recommended for kneading dough)
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 2 tsp salt
* 2+ quarts water (for boiling)
* 1/4 cup honey
* Oil/non-stick spray
* Stand mixer with dough hook
* Plastic wrap
* Parchment paper
* 2 baking sheets
* Large pot/dutch oven
* Wire rack
* Measuring cups/spoons

### Directions
1. Whisk the warm water and yeast together in the stand mixer bowl, ensuring the dough hook is attached and letting the mixture sit for 5 minutes to activate the yeast.
2. Beat flour, sugar, and salt into the water/yeast mixture for 2 minutes to make a stiff dough.
3. Remove the dough from the bowl and knead the dough for 5 minutes with floured hands by repeatedly stretching and folding the dough into itself.
4. Place the kneaded dough into a bowl greased with the oil/non-stick spray and cover the bowl with the plastic wrap to let the dough rest for 1 hour or potentially longer if the workspace is cold.
5. Divide the dough into 8 equally-sized pieces and roll them into balls.
6. Use your thumb to push a hole through the center of each of the balls, and then stretch each ball out into a ring with a center hole diameter of 1 1/2 in.
7. Line the two baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent the bagels from sticking to the tray when being baked.
8. Preheat the oven to 425F.
9. Fill the pot/dutch oven with the water and honey and heat until boiling.
10. Add the shaped bagels to the boiling water and boil for 1 minute on each side, flipping in between.
11. Remove the bagels from the boiling water and place them on the lined baking sheets.
12. Bake the bagels in the oven for 23 minutes and then move them to cool on the wire rack.
